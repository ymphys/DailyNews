CEO Tim Cook cited supply limitations, which caused a sequential drop in iPhone sales. However, analysts believe that a combination of internal challenges—such as modest upgrades in flagship iPhones and delayed iPhone Air release—and fierce competition from strong domestic rivals like Huawei have eroded Apple's foothold in the Chinese market. Huawei's comeback in the high-end segment particularly threatens Apple's market share, reflecting a shift in consumer preferences and intensifying market competition.",
