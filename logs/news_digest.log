CEO Tim Cook cited supply limitations, which caused a sequential drop in iPhone sales. However, analysts believe that a combination of internal challenges—such as modest upgrades in flagship iPhones and delayed iPhone Air release—and fierce competition from strong domestic rivals like Huawei have eroded Apple's foothold in the Chinese market. Huawei's comeback in the high-end segment particularly threatens Apple's market share, reflecting a shift in consumer preferences and intensifying market competition.",

      "english_brief": "Apple’s revenues in Greater China have declined for the first time in recent quarters, marking it the only region experiencing a downturn in fiscal Q4 2025. The CEO attributes much of this to supply chain limitations that constrained iPhone sales, including delays in launching new products like the iPhone Air. Beyond supply issues, Apple faces intensified competition from strong domestic brands like Huawei, whose resurgence is eroding Apple’s share in China’s premium smartphone market. Additionally, modest upgrades in flagship iPhone models have reduced consumers’ motivation to upgrade, posing further challenges to Apple’s growth in this key market.",
      "chinese_brief": "苹果在大中华区的营收在2025财年第四季度首次出现下滑，成为唯一出现业绩下降的地区。苹果CEO将主要原因归结于供应链限制，这限制了iPhone销量，包括iPhone Air发布延迟。除了供应问题，苹果还面临华为等强劲国产品牌的激烈竞争，华为的回归蚕食了苹果在中国高端手机市场的份额。此外，主力iPhone机型升级幅度有限，降低了消费者的换机意愿，对苹果在这一关键市场的增长构成挑战。"
