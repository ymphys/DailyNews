CEO Tim Cook cited supply limitations, which caused a sequential drop in iPhone sales. However, analysts believe that a combination of internal challenges—such as modest upgrades in flagship iPhones and delayed iPhone Air release—and fierce competition from strong domestic rivals like Huawei have eroded Apple's foothold in the Chinese market. Huawei's comeback in the high-end segment particularly threatens Apple's market share, reflecting a shift in consumer preferences and intensifying market competition.",

      "english_brief": "Apple’s revenues in Greater China have declined for the first time in recent quarters, marking it the only region experiencing a downturn in fiscal Q4 2025. The CEO attributes much of this to supply chain limitations that constrained iPhone sales, including delays in launching new products like the iPhone Air. Beyond supply issues, Apple faces intensified competition from strong domestic brands like Huawei, whose resurgence is eroding Apple’s share in China’s premium smartphone market. Additionally, modest upgrades in flagship iPhone models have reduced consumers’ motivation to upgrade, posing further challenges to Apple’s growth in this key market.",
      "chinese_brief": "苹果在大中华区的营收在2025财年第四季度首次出现下滑，成为唯一出现业绩下降的地区。苹果CEO将主要原因归结于供应链限制，这限制了iPhone销量，包括iPhone Air发布延迟。除了供应问题，苹果还面临华为等强劲国产品牌的激烈竞争，华为的回归蚕食了苹果在中国高端手机市场的份额。此外，主力iPhone机型升级幅度有限，降低了消费者的换机意愿，对苹果在这一关键市场的增长构成挑战。"

      "chinese_brief": "根据职场分析公司Visier的最新报告，由于人工智能尚未达到预期的替代人工效果，一些企业开始重新聘用此前裁员的员工。报告分析了全球142家公司约240万名员工的数据，发现约5.3%的被裁员工后续又被原雇主重新雇用，反映出自动化技术尚未完全实现高管们的成本缩减预期。这一趋势可能促使企业在人力资源管理上调整战略，以平衡技术投入与实际运营需求。",
      "english_brief": "According to a recent report by workplace analytics firm Visier, some companies are rehiring previously laid-off staff as AI has yet to fully meet expectations in replacing human labor. The report analyzed employment data from about 2.4 million employees across 142 companies globally and found that approximately 5.3% of laid-off employees have been rehired by their original employers. This indicates that automation technologies have not fully delivered the cost-cutting benefits anticipated by management. The trend may prompt companies to adjust their human resource strategies, balancing technology investments with operational needs.",
