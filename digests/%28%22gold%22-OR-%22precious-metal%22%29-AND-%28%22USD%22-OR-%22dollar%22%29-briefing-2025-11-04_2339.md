**Key Takeaways**
- NYDIG research indicates Bitcoin’s price movement correlates more with the US dollar strength and liquidity conditions than inflation rates.
- Greg Cipolaro, NYDIG’s global head of research, highlighted weak and inconsistent links between Bitcoin prices and inflation.
- Bitcoin tends to rally when the US dollar weakens, showing it is influenced by currency and macroeconomic liquidity dynamics.
- This insight challenges the common perception of Bitcoin as a direct hedge against inflation.

**Term Explanations**
- `NYDIG` — New York Digital Investment Group, a cryptocurrency investment and research firm.
- `Liquidity Conditions` — The availability of liquid assets (cash or easily tradable assets) in financial markets, affecting price movements and investor behavior.

**English Brief**

A recent study by NYDIG reveals that Bitcoin's price fluctuations are more closely tied to the strength of the US dollar and overall liquidity in markets rather than direct responses to inflation. This suggests that Bitcoin rallies when the dollar falls, reflecting its interaction with currency valuation and financial liquidity rather than serving strictly as an inflation hedge. These findings may influence investors and policymakers in understanding Bitcoin’s role in financial portfolios and economic conditions.

**简体中文摘要**

纽约数字投资集团（NYDIG）最近的研究显示，比特币的价格波动更多受美元强弱和市场流动性整体状况的影响，而非直接对通胀的反应。这表明比特币在美元走弱时会上涨，反映了其与货币估值和金融流动性的互动，而不仅仅是作为通胀对冲工具。这些发现可能会影响投资者和政策制定者对比特币在金融组合和经济环境中角色的理解。

**Key Takeaways**
- Gold prices declined sharply as optimism about an upcoming US-China trade deal strengthened the US dollar.
- Safe-haven demand for gold weakened as investors anticipated more stable global trade conditions.
- Technical analysis points to a 'sell on rise' strategy for gold, implying traders may sell as prices increase temporarily.
- Upcoming key US economic data releases are expected to further influence gold price direction.

**Term Explanations**
- `Safe-haven Asset` — An investment expected to retain or increase in value during times of market turbulence, e.g., gold.
- `Technical Indicators` — Tools used in financial analysis that leverage historical price and volume data to predict future market trends.
- `ASEAN Summit` — An annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, involving discussions on regional and international economic and political issues.

**English Brief**

Gold prices have declined significantly as renewed optimism over a potential trade deal between the US and China bolstered the US dollar and diminished demand for gold's safe-haven appeal. The expectation of stabilizing trade relations reduces investor uncertainty, causing some to shift away from gold. Technical market analysis further suggests selling on price rises. Key US economic data releases this week remain pivotal, as they could sway gold's near-term trajectory amid evolving global trade dynamics.
