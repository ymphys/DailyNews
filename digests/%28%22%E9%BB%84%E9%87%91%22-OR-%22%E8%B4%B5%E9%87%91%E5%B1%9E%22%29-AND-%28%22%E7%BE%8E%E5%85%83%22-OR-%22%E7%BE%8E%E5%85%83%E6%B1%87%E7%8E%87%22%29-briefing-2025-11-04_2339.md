After a recent strong rally pushing gold prices above key psychological levels of $4000 and $4100 per ounce, international gold prices have experienced volatile declines. On October 22, 2025, spot gold in London dropped to $4002.89 per ounce, marking a significant pullback. Market participants see this correction mainly as a result of profit-taking, where investors sell to realize gains following rapid price increases. This volatility underscores the sensitivity of gold markets to short-term market dynamics, despite its long-term appeal as a safe-haven asset.
