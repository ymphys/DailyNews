**Key Takeaways**
- Returning to standard time is generally better for health according to sleep scientists.
- However, the change can disrupt people's routines and requires adjustment to longer periods of darkness in winter.
- Aligning daily activities with circadian rhythms—our natural body clocks—can help mitigate negative effects.

**Term Explanations**
- `standard time` — The time zone standard without daylight saving adjustments, usually observed in fall and winter.
- `circadian rhythms` — Natural, internal processes that regulate the sleep-wake cycle and repeat roughly every 24 hours.

**English Brief**

Sleep experts emphasize that the switch back to standard time typically benefits health by better aligning with natural circadian rhythms. Yet, the transition can disrupt daily habits and requires people to adapt to longer winter nights. To optimize well-being, individuals are advised to synchronize their routines, such as eating, sleeping, and physical activity, with their body clocks.
